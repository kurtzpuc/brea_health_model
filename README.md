Model for Language Translation and Gender Misclassification

This repo pertains to a project I conducted looking at gender translation accuracy by language translation models. Consistently, LLM's mistranslate gender based on career. The model constructed was tuned to improve on this issue, while maintaining translation accuracy. Please email kurtz.h.piper@gmail.com if you want access to the repository.
